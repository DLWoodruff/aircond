Snapshots of the aircond model and associated drivers are provided here.
If you want run them:

1. Download (or clone) mpi-sppy from github and `mpi-sppy` and run

::
   
   setup.py develop

NOTE: If you running very old versions of aircond, you might have to download an old, tagged version of mpi-sppy.

2. Copy files into the appropriate subdirectories. The files have
   prefixes that tell you where they
   go. E.g. `mpisppy.tests.examples.aircond.py` should to to the
   mpi-sppy subdirectory `mpisppy/tests/examples` with `aircond.py` as
   its file name.
